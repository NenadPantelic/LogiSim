#Simple digital logic circuits in LogiSim
LogiSim examples and homework solutions

This is repository where I uploaded my homework assignments solutions and examples made in LogiSim design tool. All of the examples 
are combinational circuits that were made from NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR circuits. Also there are examples where more complex combinational
modules were used, e.g. multiplexers and decoders.

<p>As I mentioned already, these circuits were made in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/">LogiSim </a>simulation
tool. So, to use these examples, first you need to download LogiSim. LogiSim is very simple, but useful tool for designing and
analyzing circuits. This tool is visual, so all that you want to do is possible with drag-and-drop moves and clicks. You can find
some tutorials online - it is еаsy to learn, so you can master it for a few days. <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdnT_Ujq72E&list=PL9Tu_yD7oJURQqPEAQ78FggiDeiK7MqVb">This link
</a> can help you with learning LogiSim. If you're a fan of documentation and reading, use <a href = "http://engold.ui.ac.ir/~nikmehr/logisim_tutorial.pdf">this </a>.
After download and installation, open LogiSim. Under section File choose Open and select example that you want to open and use.
